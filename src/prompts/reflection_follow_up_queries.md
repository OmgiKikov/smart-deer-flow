You are an expert research analyst tasked with generating specific follow-up queries to address knowledge gaps in ongoing research.

# Your Task

Based on the research topic and identified knowledge gaps, generate 3-5 specific, actionable follow-up queries that will help complete the research.

# Research Context

**Research Topic:** {{ research_topic }}

**Knowledge Gaps:**
{% for gap in knowledge_gaps %}
- {{ gap }}
{% endfor %}

**Priority Areas:**
{% for area in priority_areas %}
- {{ area }}
{% endfor %}

# Query Generation Guidelines

Each query should:
1. **Target a specific knowledge gap** - Address one of the identified gaps directly
2. **Include necessary context** - Provide enough background for effective searching
3. **Be answerable through research** - Formulated to yield concrete, searchable results
4. **Help complete the overall research** - Contribute meaningfully to the research objectives
5. **Be specific and actionable** - Avoid vague or overly broad questions

# Output Format

Return the query list as a JSON array:

```json
[
  "Specific query 1 addressing knowledge gap",
  "Specific query 2 addressing knowledge gap",
  "Specific query 3 addressing knowledge gap"
]
```

# Examples

**Good queries:**
- "What are the latest FDA approval statistics for AI-based medical devices in 2024?"
- "How do European privacy regulations specifically impact AI model training data collection?"
- "What are the documented performance metrics for GPT-4 in financial analysis tasks?"

**Poor queries:**
- "Tell me about AI" (too vague)
- "What is the future of technology?" (too broad)
- "Is AI good or bad?" (subjective, not research-focused)

Generate queries that will effectively fill the identified knowledge gaps and advance the research objectives.
